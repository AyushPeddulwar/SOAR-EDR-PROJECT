### üîì **Attack Scenario**

- Scenario: Alex receives a file named ‚Äúyouarewelcome‚Äù and it fails to open normally and runs on Poershell.

As son as ‚Äúyouarewelcome‚Äù is executed, all the logs are sent to LimaCharlie. Rule detects this and creates an alert to admin automatically in Slack and email.

### üì¨ Email Notification

As soon as the an alert is generated by LimaCharlie, and alert email is sent to the SOC analyst , containing the basic details about the alert

### üßë‚Äçüíª Action on Choice

Analysts can investigate the alert, if true then can isolate the host system and perform forensics in order to find the entry point.

**1. Lets start with the NO**

This Rule Field indicates that the trigger would be activated when the value of the user prompt is FALSE (i.e No)

- In the Message field, clear all the information links (variables) except the endpoint name (Hostname).
- Fill in the message in the field: The Computer: <<detection_retrieval.body.routing.hostname>> was not isolated. Please Investigate

###  Testing EDR Functionality

Now test the workflow, and select ‚ÄúYes‚Äù when prompted. This should successfully run our new workflow additions.

###  Why is this possible?
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools can isolate a machine at the OS level by installing kernel-level network filters that block all outbound traffic, regardless of the network interface used.

- This is possible because EDRs hook directly into the system's networking stack (e.g., WFP on Windows, Netfilter on Linux, PF on macOS), allowing them to enforce isolation policies that persist even if the user switches Wi-Fi networks or physical interfaces. The only traffic often allowed through is to the EDR‚Äôs own control server, so the machine can remain under management while being effectively cut off from the rest of the network.
